The data collected from Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) platforms have tremendous potential in mapping Indiaâ€™s resources, agriculture, climate and disaster management, rural and urban planning and in identifying pathways for future development. Such maps can be created using free open source platforms (such as QGIS). Let us join together to create such maps through the Mapathon and end to end innovative solutions through the Hackathon.
